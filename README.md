This is a webapp I created for my H2 Computing WA2 that I made with the intention of using for my cca.
It has a navbar for easy navigation.
It also has a register, login and logout function, and records the inventory of all items used in the CCA, as well as the members skill level, instrument, and section.
There is also a section displaying the scores/tabs used in the CCA.
There is also a feedback section to give feedback for the CCA to improve, or things that has been done well.
